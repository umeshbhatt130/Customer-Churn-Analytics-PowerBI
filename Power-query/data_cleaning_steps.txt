DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION STEPS (POWER QUERY)

1. Imported raw CSV dataset containing 1M customer records.
2. Standardized column names (lowercase, trimmed spaces).
3. Changed data types (dates, integers, decimals, text).
4. Removed duplicate customer_id records.
5. Replaced NULL values:
   - complaints, service_calls, late_payments → 0
6. Fixed invalid values:
   - Age outside 0–100 → NULL
   - Credit score outside 300–900 → reset to 300
   - Negative charges → NULL
7. Cleaned text fields (gender, education, contract, payment method).
8. Created derived columns:
   - Churn Status (Churned / Active)
   - Signup Month
   - Tenure Band (0–6m, 6–12m, 1–2y, 2–5y, 5+y)
   - Income Band (<30K, 30–60K, 60–100K, 100K+)
9. Reordered columns for modeling.
